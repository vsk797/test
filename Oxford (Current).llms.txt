# 1. Introduction

This document describes the Oxford software architecture using the [C4 model](c4model.com) methodology export generated by [IcePanel](icepanel.io) at 2026-02-02 02:54:40.

I've included a description of each C4 model hierarchy level and object type that we will be referencing in this document.

Level 1 of the C4 model is the context level and shows business value provided to your users.
Level 2 of the C4 model is the container or app level and shows deployable/runnable objects in a system
Level 3 of the C4 model is the component level and shows code structure within apps/stores
An actor is a person that gets value from your system(s), lives at level 1 of the C4 model and is sometimes referred to as people or users.
A system is a group of apps/stores, often owned by a team, lives at level 1 of the C4 model and is sometimes referred to as a software system.
A group is a visual grouping or separation of objects and can live at any level of the C4 model.
An app is a deployable and/or runnable service or client, lives at level 2 of the C4 model and is referred to as a container in the C4 model.
A store is a database or storage bucket, lives at level 2 of the C4 model and is referred to as a container in the C4 model.
A component is a building block of an app/store and lives at level 3 of the C4 model
IcePanel does not use level 4 of the C4 model.
IcePanel adds an extra level 0 at the start of the C4 model called domains that are used to separate the software architecture into high level business or logical areas

The DAL is an internal service component that retrieves business‑ready data from the **Gold Semantic Model** (Delta Lake) and returns it to API controllers as structured, validated domain objects. It performs all table reads, filtering, joins, and aggregations required by API endpoints.

When a controller needs data (e.g., KPIs, officers, households, teams), it calls a DAL function. The DAL executes the underlying Delta Lake queries, converts the raw lake results into **typed Pydantic DTOs**, applies role‑based visibility filters (based on claims from AuthMiddleware), and then returns the finished data object directly back to the requesting controller.
